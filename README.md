# Roblox RPC (RbxRPC)

## In short

RbxRPC is a library that makes and calls RemoteEvents automatically, so you don't have to.

## In long

RbxRPC is an API for the easy contruction of remote procedure calls (RPCs); that is, make
functions cross the client/server boundary without the end user needing to make the transmissions of
data themselves. In ROBLOX, data can be transmitted through RemoteFunction objects; RbxRPC allows you
to automatically generate versions of your codebase that use RemoteFunctions when they need to cross
the client-server boundary, without creating a single RemoteFunction yourself.

## How To Use
This is a work in progress. For now, see the example project, located in the GitHub repository.
